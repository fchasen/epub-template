		<p>Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow;
		and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk
		behind some black-currant bushes.</p>
		<p>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner,
		but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate, and was
		safe at last in the wood outside the garden.</p>
